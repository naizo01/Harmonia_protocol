# Harmonia Protocol

The Harmonia Protocol is designed to ensure the sustainable prosperity of the community. It stabilizes tokenomics by intervening in DEX transactions, specifically by adjusting fees based on discounts for community members and the deviation rate from the oracle.

To determine community membership, joining the Discord server is required. For seamless integration, Lit Protocol and Web3Auth are utilized. Membership proof is recorded in the Sign Attestation. The use of OAuth access tokens for authentication, along with Lit encryption to anonymize Discord IDs, ensures both seamless integration with the Discord community and the safety of member data.
